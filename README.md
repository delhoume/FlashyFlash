This app is an editor for lists of flashes in Invader's FlashInvaders app. 

https://www.space-invaders.com/flashinvaders/

Currently a work-in-progress, some parts work, some not and some in between

The app is written in Kotlin and code is very naive as I learn Jetpack Commpose
(and I don't like it :-)

The app will crash often and is not finished

It can be a basis for a more polished app, not sure this one will go to production one day

In any case feel free to contact me for any question.
